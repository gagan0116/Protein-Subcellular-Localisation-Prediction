Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1/1 [==============================] - 1s 624ms/step\n","[1 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[1 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 0 0]\n","0.8\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 1] [0 0 0 1 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 1 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0 1]\n","0.8\n","[1 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[1 0 0 0 1] [1 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","[1 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 1]\n","1.0\n","[1 0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 1 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","[0 0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 1 0]\n","1.0\n","Average Accuracy:  0.8356666666666666\n","Accuracy:  0.9541333333333334\n","Average Normalized Accuracy:  0.8523333333333334\n","Average Precision:  0.9039813519813521\n","Average Recall:  0.8593846153846154\n","F1 score: 0.8811190426316404\n","Grand Mean: 0.8811030572218234\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1344: UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples.
